    <h3>About CarKART</h3>
      <p>CARKart is an online marketplace that connects car buyers and sellers. Sellers can browse through car listings through functionalities including creating or viewing car listings, using search filters, sharing or viewing customer reviews, and generating car comparisons. The target audience are adults ages 18 and above. On average, buyers only examine and compare approximately 3.3 car brands when shopping [1]. Thus, it shows a lack of market awareness of buyers which limits their purchasing options. This web application aims to help buyers gain autonomy in the buying process by providing information including pricing, pictures, comparisons and reviews to help them make an informed purchasing decision.</p>
